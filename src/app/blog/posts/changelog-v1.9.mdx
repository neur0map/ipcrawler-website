## Performance Enhancements

This release focuses on speed and efficiency improvements across all scanning phases.

### ‚ö° Scanning Speed
- **Parallel port ranges**: Split scanning into chunks for 3x faster discovery
- **Optimized timeouts**: Reduced RTT timeout from 500ms to 100ms
- **Better threading**: Improved CPU utilization for multi-core systems

### üíæ Memory Optimization
- **Streaming results**: Process results as they arrive instead of buffering
- **Efficient data structures**: 40% less memory usage on large scans
- **Garbage collection**: Better cleanup between scan phases

### üìù Wordlist Processing
- **Cached wordlists**: Load common wordlists once, reuse across scans
- **Smart filtering**: Skip redundant paths based on discovered technologies
- **Compression**: Support for gzipped wordlists

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed memory leak when scanning large networks
- Resolved Unicode errors in international domain names
