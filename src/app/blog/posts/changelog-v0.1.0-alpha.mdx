## IPCrawler v0.1.0-alpha-1

Welcome to the first alpha release of IPCrawler! This early version introduces our core concept: intelligent wordlist selection that saves time and improves results.

## üß† SmartList Algorithm (Alpha)

Our main feature that makes IPCrawler different:

<CodeBlock codes={[
  {
    code: `# Example: SmartList finds WordPress and recommends specific wordlists
SmartList Recommendations for target.com:443 (WordPress detected):

HIGH Confidence:
  üìÅ wordpress-plugins.txt  
  üìÅ wp-admin-panels.txt
  
MEDIUM Confidence:  
  üìÅ common-web-dirs.txt`,
    language: "plaintext"
  }
]} />

**What SmartList does:**
- Analyzes discovered services (web servers, databases, etc.)
- Matches technologies to specialized wordlists  
- Provides confidence ratings (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Eliminates guesswork in wordlist selection

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features

- **Port Scanning**: Fast discovery of open services
- **Service Detection**: Identifies running applications  
- **Smart Recommendations**: Technology-aware wordlist suggestions
- **Simple Reports**: Easy-to-read scan results

## üöß Alpha Limitations

This is an early alpha release with basic functionality:
