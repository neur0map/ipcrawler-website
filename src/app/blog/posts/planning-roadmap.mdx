## IPCrawler Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines our vision for IPCrawler's future development. As an alpha project, we're focused on building a solid foundation before adding advanced features.

## üéØ Short-term Goals (Next 3-6 months)

### Core Stability
- **Alpha to Beta**: Stabilize the v0.1.0-alpha codebase
- **Error Handling**: Improve robustness and error recovery
- **Documentation**: Complete user guides and setup instructions
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing across different environments

### SmartList Improvements
- **Expand Technology Database**: Add more service detection patterns
- **Improve Accuracy**: Refine confidence scoring algorithms
- **User Feedback**: Collect real-world usage data to improve recommendations

## üöÄ Medium-term Vision (6-12 months)

### Advanced Features
- **Multi-Tool Integration**: Chain tools like Nuclei, Subfinder, HTTPx
- **Custom Workflows**: User-defined scanning sequences
- **Better Reporting**: Enhanced output formats and visualization

### Performance Enhancements
- **Speed Optimizations**: Faster scanning and processing
- **Resource Management**: Better memory and CPU usage
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent scanning improvements

## üåü Long-term Aspirations (12+ months)

### Intelligence Layer
- **Pattern Learning**: Learn from successful scans to improve recommendations
- **Contextual Awareness**: Better understanding of target environments
- **Adaptive Scanning**: Adjust scanning behavior based on findings

### User Experience
- **Web Interface**: Optional GUI for easier operation
- **API Integration**: REST API for tool integration
- **Collaborative Features**: Team scanning and result sharing

## üß† SmartList Evolution

Our core differentiator will continue evolving:

### Current State (Alpha)
- Basic technology detection
- Simple wordlist mapping
- Manual confidence scoring

### Planned Improvements
- **Dynamic Learning**: Improve recommendations based on success rates
- **Context Awareness**: Consider target environment (CTF, enterprise, etc.)
- **Community Contributions**: Crowd-sourced technology patterns

## üí° Research Areas

We're exploring these concepts for future development:

- **Behavioral Analysis**: Understanding how different tools perform together
- **Success Prediction**: Estimating scan success probability
- **Resource Optimization**: Smart resource allocation for large scans

## ü§ù Community Involvement

IPCrawler's development will be community-driven:

- **Open Source**: Transparent development process
- **User Feedback**: Regular community input on features
- **Contributions**: Welcoming code, patterns, and documentation
