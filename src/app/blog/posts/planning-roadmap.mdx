## IPCrawler Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines our vision for IPCrawler's future development. As an alpha project, we're focused on building a solid foundation before adding advanced features.

## üéØ Short-term Goals (Next 3-6 months)

### Core Stability
- [ ] **Alpha to Beta**: Stabilize the v0.1.0-alpha codebase
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Improve robustness and error recovery
- [ ] **Documentation**: Complete user guides and setup instructions
- [ ] **Testing**: Comprehensive testing across different environments

### SmartList Improvements
- [ ] **Expand Technology Database**: Add more service detection patterns
- [ ] **Improve Accuracy**: Refine confidence scoring algorithms
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Collect real-world usage data to improve recommendations

## üöÄ Medium-term Vision (6-12 months)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **Multi-Tool Integration**: Chain tools like Nuclei, Subfinder, HTTPx
- [ ] **Custom Workflows**: User-defined scanning sequences
- [ ] **Better Reporting**: Enhanced output formats and visualization

### Detection Workflows
- [ ] **Expanded Detection Patterns**: More comprehensive service identification
- [ ] **Multi-Stage Detection**: Sequential detection workflows for complex environments
- [ ] **Protocol-Specific Workflows**: Specialized detection for HTTP, SSH, FTP, etc.
- [ ] **Vulnerability Detection Integration**: Connect findings to known vulnerabilities

### Performance Enhancements
- [ ] **Speed Optimizations**: Faster scanning and processing
- [ ] **Resource Management**: Better memory and CPU usage
- [ ] **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent scanning improvements

## üåü Long-term Aspirations (12+ months)

### Intelligence Layer
- [ ] **Pattern Recognition**: Analyze successful scans to improve recommendations
- [ ] **Contextual Awareness**: Better understanding of target environments
- [ ] **Adaptive Scanning**: Adjust scanning behavior based on findings

### User Experience
- [ ] **Web Interface**: Optional GUI for easier operation
- [ ] **API Integration**: REST API for tool integration
- [ ] **Collaborative Features**: Team scanning and result sharing

### Workflow Templates
- [ ] **Pre-built Workflows**: Ready-to-use scanning templates for common scenarios
- [ ] **Multi-Tool Templates**: Coordinated workflows using multiple security tools
- [ ] **Environment-Specific Templates**: CTF, pentest, bug bounty, enterprise scanning
- [ ] **Community Template Library**: Shared workflows from the community

## üß† SmartList Evolution

Our core differentiator will continue evolving:

### Current State (Alpha)
- Basic technology detection
- Simple wordlist mapping
- Manual confidence scoring

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] **Dynamic Learning**: Improve recommendations based on success rates
- [ ] **Context Awareness**: Consider target environment (CTF, enterprise, etc.)
- [ ] **Community Contributions**: Crowd-sourced technology patterns

## üí° Research Areas

We're exploring these concepts for future development:

- [ ] **Behavioral Analysis**: Understanding how different tools perform together
- [ ] **Success Prediction**: Estimating scan success probability
- [ ] **Resource Optimization**: Smart resource allocation for large scans
- [ ] **AI Integration**: Potential AI-powered enhancements (long-term exploration)
- [ ] **Workflow Wizard**: Interactive tool for building custom scanning workflows
- [ ] **Visual Workflow Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating tool chains

## ü§ù Community Involvement

IPCrawler's development will be community-driven:

- **Open Source**: Transparent development process
- **User Feedback**: Regular community input on features
- **Contributions**: Welcoming code, patterns, and documentation
