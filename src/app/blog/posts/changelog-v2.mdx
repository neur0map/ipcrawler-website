## What's New in v2.0

The biggest IPCrawler update yet focuses on intelligence and speed, introducing the revolutionary SmartList Algorithm alongside major performance improvements.

## 🧠 SmartList Algorithm

The headline feature - intelligent wordlist recommendations based on discovered services:

- **Automatic Analysis**: Evaluates all discovered services
- **Confidence Scoring**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW recommendations
- **Technology Mapping**: 200+ technology patterns recognized
- **Pattern Database**: Uses comprehensive technology-to-wordlist mappings
