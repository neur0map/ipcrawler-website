## Overview

HTTP Intelligence is SmartList's most valuable data source. **When it detects WordPress, SmartList knows to recommend wp-plugins.txt. When it finds Laravel, SmartList suggests laravel-routes.txt.** Every CMS, framework, and technology detected becomes precise intelligence for perfect wordlist selection.

## Key Features

- **Technology Detection**: Identifies CMS, frameworks, servers, and languages
- **Smart Directory Bruteforcing**: Context-aware wordlist selection
- **Virtual Host Discovery**: Finds hidden vhosts and subdomains
- **Security Header Analysis**: Evaluates defensive configurations

## Multi-Tool Orchestration

IPCrawler intelligently combines:
- **WhatWeb**: Technology fingerprinting and version detection
- **Gobuster**: High-performance directory and file discovery
- **Curl**: Custom header analysis and response inspection
- **DNSRecon**: Subdomain enumeration when applicable

## Smart Enumeration Logic

```python
# Detected: WordPress on port 443
# IPCrawler automatically selects:
- /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/CMS/wordpress.txt
- /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/CMS/wp-plugins.txt
- Custom HTTPS-specific paths

# Detected: Apache Tomcat
# IPCrawler automatically selects:
- /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/tomcat.txt
- Java-specific endpoints
- Management interface paths
```

## Advanced Detection Examples

Real-world detection capabilities:
- **WordPress**: Version, themes, plugins, users enumeration
- **Joomla/Drupal**: Component discovery, version fingerprinting
- **Custom Apps**: Framework detection (Laravel, Django, Spring)
- **APIs**: Endpoint discovery, documentation URLs
- **Admin Panels**: Common paths across technologies

## Directory Discovery Strategy

1. **Initial Fast Scan**: Common files and directories
2. **Technology-Specific**: Based on detected stack
3. **Deep Enumeration**: Extended wordlists for thorough coverage
4. **Recursive Discovery**: Follow discovered directories

## Security Intelligence

- **Missing Headers**: Identifies absent security headers
- **Information Disclosure**: Detects verbose errors, debug modes
- **Misconfigurations**: Default pages, directory listings
- **Vulnerable Components**: Known vulnerable versions

## Outcome

This phase transforms basic "port 80/443 open" information into a comprehensive web application attack surface map. In 1-3 minutes, you get intelligence that would typically require 30+ minutes of manual tool orchestration and result correlation.
