IPCrawler v0.1.0-alpha-2 Release Notes

  üéØ Major Enhancement: SmartList Intelligence & Privacy Overhaul

  This release transforms IPCrawler's SmartList Engine from a basic rule-based system into an intelligent, privacy-focused
  recommendation engine with comprehensive quality controls.

  üöÄ New Features

  1. Entropy Analysis System

  - Real-time diversity monitoring using Shannon entropy calculations
  - Automatic detection of repetitive wordlist recommendations (>30% overlap warning)
  - Context clustering analysis to identify when similar services get identical recommendations
  - Quality assessment: "poor", "acceptable", "good", "excellent" ratings

  2. Comprehensive Audit Framework

  - Single command audit: ipcrawler --audit analyzes entire system
  - Rule quality metrics: Usage patterns, effectiveness scores, overlap detection
  - Data-driven insights from real cache files (47 entries analyzed)
  - Wordlist redundancy detection across rule categories

  3. Discriminator-Based Scoring

  - Intelligent frequency adjustments: Rare signals (+0.1), overused signals (-0.1)
  - Synergy bonuses for complementary rule matches (+0.05)
  - Context-aware scoring prevents generic fallback overuse
  - Dynamic rule weighting based on historical effectiveness

  4. Privacy-First Caching

  - Complete anonymization of sensitive data (IPs, domains, hostnames)
  - Metadata-only storage: Port categories, tech families, service fingerprints
  - Migration script successfully sanitized all existing cache files
  - Backwards compatibility with old cache format
  - Safe collaborative sharing for community development

  5. Wordlist Diversification

  - 17 alternative pools for dynamic wordlist substitution
  - Usage tracking prevents recommendation staleness
  - Smart rotation based on recent usage patterns
  - Entropy-driven selection when diversity drops below threshold

  Measurable Improvements

  - Entropy scoring: 0.0-1.0 diversity measurement
  - Quality thresholds: <0.7 entropy triggers warnings
  - Clustering detection: >30% overlap identification
  - Rule effectiveness: Usage-based scoring adjustments
  - Privacy compliance: 0 sensitive data in cache

  üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy

  Data Protection

  - Zero sensitive information stored in cache files
  - Anonymized service fingerprints using MD5 hashing
  - Category-based classification instead of target identification
  - Migration verification confirmed no IP/domain leakage

  Collaborative Safety

  - Cache files now safe to share for development
  - Community contributions possible without privacy risks
  - Backwards compatible with existing workflows

  üéØ User Experience

  Single Command Audit

  ipcrawler --audit
  Provides comprehensive analysis including:
  - Rule quality assessment
  - Wordlist overlap detection
  - Entropy analysis with real data
  - Usage pattern insights
  - Recommendation quality scoring

  Intelligent Recommendations

  - Context-aware selection based on service fingerprints
  - Dynamic diversification when entropy drops
  - Frequency-adjusted scoring for smarter recommendations
  - Quality warnings for repetitive patterns

  üîÑ Migration Notes

  Automatic Cache Migration

  - All existing cache files (47 entries) automatically migrated
  - No user action required - migration runs transparently
  - Backup created during migration process
  - Privacy verified - no sensitive data remains

  Backwards Compatibility

  - Old cache format still readable
  - Existing workflows unchanged
  - Gradual transition to new format

  üêõ Bug Fixes
